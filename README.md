# Light AI
## The main idea with this project is to learn the basics o AI, but try something new. 
The algorithm will have to
- [ ] Open an mp3 file
  - [ ] Know the main frequencies of the music
  - [ ] Run a conversational AI [probably this one](https://github.com/deepmipt/DeepPavlov)
  - [ ] Create a file with some material that I donÂ´t know yet (Like keywords, notes, frequencies)
- [ ] Read that file and create a showfile
  - [ ] Read the file
  - [ ] Create an Idea archive (Based on the information in the file)
  - [ ] Transform the Idea archive in a showfile
  
## Then I'll have the GUI
- [ ] GUI
  - [ ] Create the stage
    - [ ] Things here
  - [ ] Run the main algorithm
  - [ ] Show other projects I've made
